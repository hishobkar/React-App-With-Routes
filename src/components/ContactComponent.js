//       <p>With styled-components, we can write actual CSS in our JavaScript file. This means you can use all the features of CSS — like media queries, pseudo-selectors, nesting, and more — in JavaScript.

// styled-components use ES6’s tagged template literals to style components. With it, the mapping between components and styles is removed. This means that when you’re defining your styles, you’re actually creating a normal React component that has your styles attached to it.

// Using styled-components, we can create reusable components with styles. It is quite exciting to create and use.

// To get started, we need to install it by running $ npm install --save styled-components in your React app’s directory.</p>
//       {/* Your Contact content */}
//     </div>

<></> // Move this html code to the about page
